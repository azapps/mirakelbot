# Mirakelbot

This is a tiny IRC bot written in Haskell to learn this wonderful language ;)

It is just a small project to learn haskell. If you want to use it in a production environment consider to use [Lambdabot](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Lambdabot)

It is based on http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Roll_your_own_IRC_bot but is highly modified.

## TODO

* more commands
* recognize mentioning
* implement `!users` better
* Answer in the appropriate channel
* Use Î» instead of !
* Read config from config file
* Command line options
* Fix `ghc -Wall` warnings
